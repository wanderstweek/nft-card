## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Last couple of weeks I am studying Flexbox, so this was a good practice.
One other interesting thing that i learned was how to put that hover icon over the main image.



### Continued development

I will continue to take HTML & CSS challenges from FrontendMentor.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is my main tutorial website that I use for quick reminders.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This place I visit when I need to learn something new, because they explain things in detail.
